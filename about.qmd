Hello! I’m Saumya Chaudhary, a passionate Master's student in Business Analytics at Monash University, Melbourne. With a Bachelor’s in Business Administration and hands-on experience as a Sales Associate and Corporate advisor, I’ve developed a strong foundation in understanding market dynamics and customer insights.

I’m eager to apply my analytical skills to solve complex business challenges and drive strategic outcomes. My journey through the world of data analytics excites me, and I look forward to exploring innovative solutions that can shape business strategies.

Outside of academia, I enjoy hiking, binge-watching, and keeping up with the latest technological advancements. I’d love to connect with like-minded individuals or collaborate on projects that could benefit from a data-focused perspective!
